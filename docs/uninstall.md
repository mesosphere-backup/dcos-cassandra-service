Uninstalling a cluster is straightforward. Replace `cassandra` with the name of the Cassandra instance to be uninstalled.

```
$ dcos package uninstall --app-id=cassandra
```

Then, use the [framework cleaner script](https://docs.mesosphere.com/1.8/usage/managing-services/uninstall/) to remove your Cassandra instance from Zookeeper and destroy all data associated with it. The script requires several arguments. The default values are:

- `framework_role` is `cassandra-role`.
- `framework_principal` is `cassandra-principal`.
- `zk_path` is `dcos-service-<service-name>`.

These values may vary if you customized them during installation.

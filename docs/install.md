# Default Installation
Prior to installing a default cluster, ensure that your DC/OS cluster has at least 3 DC/OS slaves with 8 Gb of memory, 10 Gb of disk available on each agent. Also, ensure that ports 7000, 7001, 7199, 9042, and 9160 are available.

To start a default cluster, run the following command on the DC/OS CLI. The default installation may not be sufficient for a production deployment, but all cluster operations will work. If you are planning a production deployment with 3 replicas of each value and with local quorum consistency for read and write operations (a very common use case), this configuration is sufficient for development and testing purposes and it may be scaled to a production deployment.

```
$ dcos package install cassandra
```

This command creates a new Cassandra cluster with 3 nodes. Two clusters cannot share the same name, so installing additional clusters beyond the default cluster requires [customizing the `name` at install time](#custom-installation) for each additional instance.

If you have more than one Cassandra cluster, use the `--name` argument after install time to specify which Cassandra instance to query. All `dcos cassandra` CLI commands accept the `--name` argument. If you do not specify a service name, the CLI assumes the default value, `cassandra`.

# Custom Installation

If you are ready to ship into production, you will likely need to customize the deployment to suite the workload requirements of your application(s). Customize the default deployment by creating a JSON file, then pass it to `dcos package install` using the `--options` parameter.

Sample JSON options file named `sample-cassandra.json`:

```
{
    "nodes": {
        "count": 10,
        "seeds": 3
    }
}
```

The command below creates a cluster using `sample-cassandra.json`:

```
$ dcos package install --options=sample-cassandra.json cassandra
```

This cluster will have 10 nodes and 3 seeds instead of the default values of 3 nodes and 2 seeds.
See [Configuration Options](#configuration-options) for a list of fields that can be customized via an options JSON file when the Cassandra cluster is created.

# Minimal Installation
You may wish to install Cassandra on a local DC/OS cluster for development or testing purposes. For this, you can use [dcos-vagrant](https://github.com/mesosphere/dcos-vagrant).
As with the default installation, you must ensure that ports 7000, 7001, 7199, 9042, and 9160 are available.

**Note:** This configuration will not support replication of any kind, but it may be sufficient for early stage evaluation and development.

To start a minimal cluster with a single node, create a JSON options file that contains the following:

```
{
    "service" : {
       "cpus": 0.1,
       "mem": 512,
       "heap": 256
    },
    "nodes": {
        "cpus": 0.5,
        "mem": 2048,
        "disk": 4096,
        "heap": {
            "size": 1024,
            "new": 100
        },
        "count": 1,
        "seeds": 1
    },
    "executor" : {
       "cpus": 0.1,
       "mem": 512,
       "heap": 256
    },
    "task" : {
       "cpus": 0.1,
       "mem": 128
    }
}
```
This will create a single node cluster with 2 Gb of memory and 4Gb of disk. Note that you will need an additional 512 Mb for the DC/OS Cassandra Service executor and 128 Mb for clusters tasks. The DC/OS Cassandra Service scheduler needs 512 MB to run, but it does not need to be deployed on the same host as the node.

# Multiple Cassandra Cluster Installation

Installing multiple Cassandra clusters is identical to installing a Cassandra cluster with a custom configuration as described above. Use a JSON options file to specify a unique `name` for each installation:

```
$ cat cassandra1.json
{
   "service": {
       "name": "cassandra1"
   }
}

$ dcos package install cassandra --options=cassandra1.json
```

In order to avoid port conflicts, by default you cannot collocate more than one Cassandra instance on the same node.

# Installation Plan

When the DC/OS Cassandra service is initially installed it will generate an installation plan as shown below. You can view, pause, and resume installation via the REST API. See [REST API authentication][#rest-auth] for information on how this request must be authenticated.

                }
            ],

        }
    ],
    "status": "InProgress"
}
```

## Viewing the Installation Plan
The plan can be viewed from the API via the REST endpoint. A curl example is provided below.

```
$ curl -H "Authorization: token=$AUTH_TOKEN" http://<dcos_url>/service/cassandra/v1/plan
```

## Plan Errors
If there are any errors that prevent installation, these errors are dispayed in the errors list. The presence of errors indicates that the installation cannot progress. See the [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting) section for information on resolving errors.

## Reconciliation Phase
The first phase of the installation plan is the reconciliation phase. This phase ensures that the DC/OS Cassandra service maintains the correct status for the Cassandra nodes that it has deployed. Reconciliation is a normal operation of the DC/OS Cassandra Service and occurs each time the service starts. See [the Mesos documentation](http://mesos.apache.org/documentation/latest/reconciliation) for more information.

## Deploy Phase
The second phase of the installation is the deploy phase. This phase will deploy the requested number of Cassandra nodes. Each block in the phase represents an individual Cassandra node. In the plan shown above the first node, node-0, has been deployed, the second node, node-1, is in the process of being deployed, and the third node, node-2, is pending deployment based on the completion of node-1.

## Pausing Installation
In order to pause installation, issue a REST API request as shown below. The installation will pause after completing installation of the current node and wait for user input.

```
$ curl -X POST -H "Authorization: token=$AUTH_TOKEN" http:/<dcos_url>/service/cassandra/v1/plan/interrupt
```


## Resuming Installation
If the installation has been paused, the REST API request below will resume installation at the next pending node.

```
$ curl -X POST -H "Authorization: token=$AUTH_TOKEN" http://<dcos_url>/service/cassandra/v1/plan/continue
```

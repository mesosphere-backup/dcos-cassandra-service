Running Tests:
--------------

Setup
#####

Tox, our test runner, tests against both Python 2.7 and Python 3.4 environments.

If you're using OS X, be sure to use the officially distributed Python 3.4 installer_ since the
Homebrew version is missing a necessary library.

Running
#######

Tox will run unit and integration tests in both Python environments using a temporarily created
virtualenv.

You should ensure :code:`DCOS_CONFIG` is set and that the config file points to the Marathon
instance you want to use for integration tests.

There are two ways to run tests, you can either use the virtualenv created by :code:`make env`
above::

    make test

Or, assuming you have tox installed (via :code:`sudo pip install tox`)::

    tox

Other Useful Commands

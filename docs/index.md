# Overview

DC/OS Apache Cassandra is an automated service that makes it easy to deploy and manage on Mesosphere DC/OS. DC/OS Cassandra eliminates nearly all of the complexity traditionally associated with managing a Cassandra cluster. Apache Cassandra is a distributed database management system designed to handle large amounts of data across many nodes, providing horizonal scalablity and high availability with no single point of failure, with a simple query language (CQL). For more information on Apache Cassandra, see the Apache Cassandra [documentation](http://docs.datastax.com/en/cassandra/2.2/pdf/cassandra22.pdf). DC/OS Cassandra gives you direct access to the Cassandra API so that existing applications can interoperate. You can configure and install DC/OS Cassandra in moments. Multiple Cassandra clusters can be installed on DC/OS and managed independently, so you can offer Cassandra as a managed service to your organization.

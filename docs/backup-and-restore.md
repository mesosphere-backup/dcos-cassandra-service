DC/OS Apache Cassandra supports backup and restore from S3 storage for disaster recovery purposes.

Cassandra takes a snapshot of your tables and ships them to a remote location. Once the snapshots have been uploaded to a remote location, you can restore the data to a new cluster, in the event of a disaster, or restore them to an existing cluster, in the event that a user error has caused a data loss.

# Backup

You can take a complete snapshot of your DC/OS Apache Cassandra ring and upload the artifacts to S3 or to Azure.

**Note:** These instructions describe how to back up the _data_ in your Cassandra ring. You must back up your Cassandra _schemas_ manually.

## S3 Backup

To perform a backup to S3, enter the following command on the DC/OS CLI:

```
$ dcos cassandra --name=<service-name> backup start \
    --backup_name=<backup-name> \
    --external_location=s3://<bucket-name> \
    --s3_access_key=<s3-access-key> \
    --s3_secret_key=<s3-secret-key>
```

To upload to S3, you must specify the "s3://" protocol for the external location along with setting the S3 flags for access key and secret key.

To check the status of the backup from the CLI, enter the following command:

```
$ dcos cassandra --name=<service-name> backup status
```

To cancel a currently running backup from the CLI, enter the following command:

```
$ dcos cassandra --name=<service-name> backup stop
```

The operation will end after the current node has finished its backup.

## Azure Backup

To perform a backup to Azure, enter the following command on the DC/OS CLI:

```
$ dcos cassandra --name=<service-name> backup start \
    --backup_name=<backup-name> \
    --external_location=azure://<container> \
    --azure_account=<account_name> \
    --azure_key=<key>
```

To upload to Azure, you must specify the "azure://" protocol for the external location along with setting the Azure flags for Azure storage account and a secret key.

To check the status of the backup from the CLI, enter the following command:

```
$ dcos cassandra --name=<service-name> backup status
```

To cancel a currently running backup from the CLI, enter the following command:

```
$ dcos cassandra --name=<service-name> backup stop
```

The operation will end after the current node has finished its backup.

# Restore

You can restore your DC/OS Apache Cassandra snapshots on a new Cassandra ring from S3 or from Azure storage.

## S3 Restore

To restore, enter the following command on the DC/OS CLI:

```
$ dcos cassandra --name=<service-name> restore start \
    --backup_name=<backup-name> \
    --external_location=s3://<bucket-name> \
    --s3_access_key=<s3-access-key> \
    --s3_secret_key=<s3-secret-key>
```

To restore from S3, you must specify the "s3://" protocol for the external location along with setting the S3 flags for access key and secret key.

Check the status of the restore:

    $ dcos cassandra --name=<service-name> restore status

## Azure Restore

To restore, enter the following command on the DC/OS CLI:

```
$ dcos cassandra --name=<service-name> restore start \
    --backup_name=<backup-name> \
    --external_location=azure://<container-name> \
    --azure_account=<account_name> \
    --azure_key=<key>
```

To restore from Azure, you must specify the "azure://" protocol for the external location along with setting the Azure flags for Azure storage account and a secret key.

To check the status of the restore from the CLI, enter the following command:

```
$ dcos cassandra --name=<service-name> restore status
```

To cancel a currently running restore from the CLI, enter the following command:

```
$ dcos cassandra --name=<service-name> restore stop
```

The operation will end after the current node has finished its restore.

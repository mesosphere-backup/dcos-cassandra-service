The DC/OS Cassandra Service is engineered and tested to work with a specific release of [Apache Cassandra](http://cassandra.apache.org), the base technology. We select stable versions of the base technology in order to promote customer success. We have selected the latest stable version from the Apache Cassandra 3.0.x release train for new releases. Our partner, DataStax, has found that that 3.0.x is the most stable release train.
